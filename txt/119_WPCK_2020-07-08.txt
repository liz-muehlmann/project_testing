Weary Nurses Continue to Serve on Pandemic Front Lines

contagions or chaos on the job -- but the mysterious virus 
COVID-19 creates anxiety she and her fellow RNs bravely

That's what we do." Kaitlyn talks with K-LOVE's Marya

Socially Distanced Encouragement: Kindergarten Teacher 
Met with Drive-By Cheers After Last Cancer Treatment
After completing her last day of chemo for breast cancer, 
kindergarten teacher Jennifer Owens had to avoid 
personal contact to stay safe from the COVID-19 virus. But 
that didn’t stop people from encouraging her! 250 cars 
with family, friends and students surprised her with a huge 
parade outside of her home in Hammond, Louisiana. 
Jennifer’s daughter Emily came from college to take care 
of her and said they’d sing Christian songs together. “We 
would play K-LOVE and she would sing to me and dance 
while we waited for the spinal taps to be done.” Emily, 
Jennifer’s daughter, has helped her post weekly Facebook 
live updates on their “Faith over Fear” page and Jennifer 
has continued to have story time online for her 
kindergarten students. She wants to let her “babies” know 
that she’s doing great. Jennifer’s daughter Emily came 
from college to take care of her and said they’d sing 
Christian songs together. “We would play K-LOVE and she 
would sing to me and dance while we waited for the spinal 
taps to be done.”
Veterans Proud To Serve Again - As Teachers
Veterans are transitioning from a life of service for their 
country to a life of service in their communities through a 
program called Troops To Teachers. Troops To Teachers 
operates in each state. Once current members of the 
Armed Forces or those who have been honorably 
discharged apply, the national office notifies candidates. 
Vane says the impact isn’t just on students but veterans 
who choose the program. “I think many people get 
involved in the military as a way of service. And then of 
course in the medical field as a way of service. And so I 
think both Dr. Perrin and I…what caught our eye with 
Troops to Teachers is that motto: ‘Proud to serve again.’”
Training Students For The Tech World With Christian 
Values
Graduating from college is a dream come true for many 
students. Some students however are finding it hard to 
find good paying jobs despite their time spent in school. 
Talent and education is there, but some companies are 
requiring a little bit more. Ryan Collins is CEO of Bethel 
School of Technology in Redding, California and says 
learning character principles like trust and community is 
valuable, especially when trying to land that great job. 
“We just love the idea that we can equip believers to go 
into this space and do things with excellence, create a 
really good career for themselves, but also, be able to 
represent and be ambassadors for the love of Christ.”

Beat COVID-19 Discouragement: National Backyard 
Campout – Friday
With most Americans keeping themselves at home as 
much as possible, life has changed for the time being. But 
we can only watch so much Hulu and Netflix. So, an idea to 
have some fun and make lifelong memories comes from 
Trail Life, a Christian character development organization 
– encouraging boys and young men to honor God… and 
experience outdoor adventure in God’s creation. It’s the 
Friday, April 17th National Backyard Campout.  “This is a 
great opportunity for parents to model how to manage 
difficult times,” says Mark Hancock, CEO of Trail life.

(Behind the story) Pandemic Relief: Hundreds Line-Up Cars 
and Pray at Mississippi Hospitals
Pastor Eric Camp of Action Church joined more than 20 
other churches to encourage beleaguered medical 
workers at two hospitals in coastal Mississippi. 500-to-600 
people drove to the hospitals to specifically pray and 
encourage. Many in the parking lots tuned to K-LOVE in 
their cars, prayed, praised, and sang aloud with the music.
“It was surreal to be honest with you,” says Pastor Eric, 
“and what happened was really unexpected to us. A lot of 
the medical professionals walked out on top of the 
building holding banners saying, ‘thank you’ and waving to 
the crowds. And you could just feel the presence of God 
on that campus because it was just such a blessing to 
them, but I think in turn it blessed us – just that they 
walked out. 
‘The Corona Chronicles’ – A Message Born Out of 
Circumstances
Kenny Luck, the founder of Every Man Ministries, 
understands some of the unique challenges men are 
experiencing with social-distancing and staying-at-home 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. And it might be smart for 
women to take note of this as well to get a sense of what 
the men in your family might be going through.  
During Pandemic: Chaplain Dan Encourages Our Troops in 
Afghanistan
You may not have heard how our armed forces deployed 
overseas are coping with the COVID-19 pandemic. We can 
help fill that knowledge gap by way of someone who is 
there. Chaplain Dan Thompson, a USAF Lt. Colonel, is 
based in Afghanistan. His ministry to the men and women 
serving our country has, out of necessity, changed a great 
deal since precautions got underway due to global 
pandemic. Even though the chaplain is now sharing faith 
wearing a mask and keeping social distancing, God is not 
hindered. 
Sharing Jesus With Chalk Art – During Pandemic Family 
Makes the Most of Home Life
Just like many families, a family in California’s Central 
Valley is staying close to home as much as possible 
nowadays. They’re having lots of family time and found an 
artful way to honor God and share their faith during these 
unusual times!

Giving Back in The Pandemic – Allen Marshall Buys Gas for 
Nurses
At a busy intersection near three Detroit hospitals, Allen 
Marshall did something unusual and very generous. He 
made arrangements with a gas station, then stood outside 
with his “Free Gas For Nurses” sign. The $900 he spent 
blessed a lot of very surprised medical workers. The 
money was a bit of a sacrifice. It had been set aside for 
Allen’s mother’s 97th birthday and for a tool he wanted for 
his knife-sharpening business. But since his mother was at 
a senior home, they couldn’t have a party – and the tool, 
well it could wait. This was more important to Allen and 
his wife, who works in the insurance medical field. 
Feeding The 5,000 – Church Team Blesses Community
Thousands affected by the COVID-19 lockdown received

their disaster response team handed out the food as

with Journey Church says their Disaster Response Team is 
ready to jump into action during emergencies. The team 
coordinated with four counties, food distributers, 
manufacturers and others to bless people during the 
COVID-19 situation.
Chef & Team Make Gourmet Meals to Encourage Hospital 
Staff
A Texas chef is helping feed the first responders battling 
the COVID-19 Coronavirus outbreak. Luke Rogers is 
executive chef at Savor in Klyde Warren Park in Dallas. He 
and his team have been serving hot meals weekly to the 
brave men and women risking their lives fighting this 
pandemic. “We just want to show them a big ‘thank you’ 
by what we are doing in response to what they are 
doing,” says Rogers. He says, they just want to do 
something good and continue to serve people. In the end 
he says, it doesn’t matter whether he gets his payback 
here on earth, because he’s sure he’ll get it in Heaven.

Extreme Generosity: Life Church Helps 25,000 Additional 
Churches Livestream During Pandemic
When businesses and schools closed as the COVID-19 
pandemic hit America, almost all churches stopped in-
person worship as well. Crowds were a risk of spreading 
the aggressive virus. Some churches were familiar with 
livestreaming services, but many had not done that 
before. Pastors realized the internet was about the only 
way to share sermons and live worship with the millions of 
families now staying at home for safety. But how? For 
25,000 churches there was a quick and reliable solution – 
the Church Online Platform software developed 
by Life.Church, whose home church is based in Oklahoma, 
with campuses in 11 states. Incredibly, thankfully, 
Life.Church believes in offering whatever help they can 
free-of-charge to other churches. So, for 25,000 churches 
the ability to bring their services online in high quality was 
just a matter of downloading the platform and learning. 
No charge. No strings attached.
Online Prayer Ministry Asks God to Give Gov’t Wisdom On

so you can pray for them individually.” K-LOVE’s Dan Beck

Vaping Often Fails as Alternative to Smoking
Vaping is marketed as a safe alternative to traditional 
cigarettes, but ‘dual use’ plus dramatic surge in teen 
addiction and recent links to lung disease send most e-cig 
claims up in smoke. K-LOVE’s Billie Branham talks with

‘Lasagna Lady’ Michelle Brenner Is Bringing Comfort To 
Her Hometown, One Lasagna At A Time
After being furloughed from her job as a sales manager, 
Michelle Brenner decided to fill her time helping others. 
She was shopping for food to help seniors when she was 
inspired to make homemade lasagna for those who 
couldn’t get out during the shelter-in-place orders. What 
started out as a simple post on her neighborhood 
Facebook page offering to cook and deliver homemade, 6-
pound pans of lasagna ended up with a town filled with a 
hunger for lasagna. Now known as the “Lasagna Lady,” 
Michelle Brenner guesses she’s baked more than a 
thousand pans of lasagna. She’s delivered them to fire 
departments, medical providers, prisons, the elderly and 
just about anyone who has asked.

‘Helping Others Can Help You’ – Rock Church Helps With 
Food, Looks Ahead Past COVID-19
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, San Diego-based Rock 
Church was always helping areas of the community with 
hunger and other needs. But, “when the pandemic hit, we 
just put that into overdrive,” explains Senior Pastor Miles 
McPherson. “I think one of the things that hopefully a lot 
of people have learned is…one of the ways to get your 
mind off yourself is to think about other people. You can 
sit at home and go crazy thinking about the ‘what if’ 
scenarios about your money, ‘what if’ scenarios about 
your future,” but McPherson recommends connecting to 
others can be “somewhat therapeutic.” Rock Church 
volunteers repaired and delivered 263,000 N95 masks to 
San Diego’s Office of Emergency Services. These 
respirators were placed into the County of San Diego’s 
Medical Operations Center’s warehouse for use by Health 
Care Workers. 4,284 church volunteers served in three-
hour time shifts for a total of 12,852 hours. With the help 
of restaurants and the community, the church provided 
thousands of meals to 13 hospitals in San Diego County to 
encourage “frontline hospital heroes.”

Pandemic Takes Creative Teaching To A New Level With 
Daily Character Videos
Yoda teaching English grammar? Mixed up idea, it is. 
Unless you’re Cedarville University alumna Heidi Bruder 
trying to spice up language arts for her suddenly online 
fifth through seventh graders at Calvary Christian 
Academy in West Branch, Michigan. Then it’s an idea that 
would make a Jedi master proud. Bruder usually teaches a 
very interactive class, so this March when students 
switched to online learning, she was at a loss for what to 
do. “Switching to online learning was heartbreaking for 
me,” explained Bruder. “It was hard for me to want to 
make the videos and teach the lessons because everything 
I loved about teaching, I felt was being stripped away. But 
I was convicted by what I tell my kids all the time: 
Whatever you do, do it for the Lord.”
Cody Barnhart is director of music and ministry at First 
Baptist Church in Alcoa, Tennessee. Cody explains he 
“grew up with a lot of anxiety issues and depression as a 
teenager,” which persisted during his time in seminary. He 
eventually realized how much this had impacted him. 
“Since it had affected me so personally, I’ve been pretty 
passionate about shedding light on how deep that issue 
runs in the church.” He recently wrote a first-person 
article published online by Baptist Press that spoke of the 
mental health risks that can tag even a servant of God. 
Sadly, there have been as a number of cases where 
pastors have apparently taken their own lives, including 
one pastor who had even led a mental health advocacy 
group. 
Better Dads Have A Plan
“We know in business; we know in work that you have 
goals you have you have to meet: well what’s your 
fathering plan?” K-LOVE's Bob Dittman talks with Dr. Ken 
Canfield of the National Center for Fathering about 
learning how to be good dad. "We're creating this sense of 
destiny for our lives that will be played out over and over."

Barbershop Helping Kids Develop Self-Esteem
A barber in Kutztown, Pennsylvania is helping kids develop 
self-esteem right inside his barbershop. John Escueta 
owns City Cuts Barbershop and says, when kids come in 
for a haircut, they read aloud and leave with a little more 
confidence. John says he hopes other barbershop and 
salons will adopt his “Books by Kids” program. He believes 
the more kids are able read, the world can be better place 
for all of us.

Bob ‘The Bike Man’ & Police Encourage Kids
A volunteer police officer is helping to build a better 
relationship between kids living in poor communities and 
police officers patrolling these neighborhoods. Bob 
Charland, also known as “Bob the Bike Man,” has 
partnered up with several law enforcement agencies 
throughout Massachusetts and Connecticut, collecting 
donated bikes, refurbishing them, then delivering the 
bikes to poor kids right to their schools. Bob believes 
changing the dynamic between the kids and police officers 
is important to encourage respect and understanding 
between both.
