0:60 each South Dakota has seen a steady rise in sales tax revenue following the June 2018 
Supreme Court decision allowing the state to collect money from online retailers. 
Following that decision, another associated new law went into effect last November. That
legislation requires online businesses to pay sales taxes if they conduct at least $100,000 
in gross sales in at least 200 transactions in the state. Revenue Secretary Jim Terwilliger 
says business tax licenses issued to out-of-state and online retailers since then have 
helped South Dakota pocket $15.9 million in tax revenue.

0:60 each Authorities will hold sobriety checkpoints at several South Dakota counties this month. 
Nineteen counties will have checkpoints during the month of July, according to the

counties to discourage people from drinking and driving. In our area, July checkpoints 
are planned for the counties of: Charles Mix, Lincoln, and Yankton.
0:60 each Authorities have identified the victim of a fatal motorcycle crash in Yankton on June 27th.
Fifty-five-year-old James Schirmacher, of Yankton, died of his injuries on Sunday 
according to the South Dakota Department of Public Safety. On June 27th, 16-year-old

attempted to make a left-hand turn. Her vehicle hit Schirmacher’s motorcycle which was 
traveling eastbound on South Dakota Highway 50. Authorities say Schirmacher was not

hospital where he died. The investigation into the crash is ongoing.
0:60 each Changes made to the South Dakota Codified Laws by the 2019 South Dakota Legislature 
can now be viewed on the Legislative Research Council's website. A total of 218 bills 
from the 2019 session passed the Senate and House of Representatives and were signed 
into law. Unless a bill prescribes when it will take effect or it is passed at a special 
session, a bill becomes law on the first day of July after its passage. While the Legislative
Research Council maintains the codified laws, people having questions about specific 
laws should contact the state entity that oversees and regulates them. Contact information
for state agencies, boards, and commissions is available on the South Dakota State 
Government website. For more information about South Dakota's government and 
legislature, visit the Student Resources page on the Legislative Research Council 
website.
0:60 each Changes to the Yankton High School/Summit Activities Center parking lot will be on the 
agenda tonight for the Yankton School Board. The agenda for tonight’s meeting states 
that an original contract for the project was awarded in January at approximately 
$380,000 – however, after the discovery of additional deterioration and a subsequent 
independent assessment, the revised contract amount is now almost $890,000. The school
district is responsible for 60% of the cost with the City of Yankton responsible for the 
remaining 40%. The meeting is set for 5:30 p.m. Monday at the district administration 
building.
0:60 each Time is running out for individuals to file and receive assistance benefits from FEMA and
their partners that are in Yankton County. The Yankton County Office of Emergency 
Management, along with the state Department of Public Safety and FEMA are 
encouraging residents who suffered loss and damage from this spring’s severe weather 
and flooding to file before the August 6th, deadline. Folks wanting to submit a claim will 
need to provide some basic information as well as their Social Security Number, any 
private insurance information, address and zip code, as well as a phone number and basic
directions to their home. There are several ways to register for assistance – by calling 
FEMA offices, going to their website at disasterassistance.gov, or stopping in and visiting
with a representative at the Disaster Recovery Office in Yankton on Capital Street. For 
any questions or more information you can also contact the Yankton Office of Emergency
Management.
0:60 each Yankton City officials are asking travelers to make alternate plans when driving down a 
portion of 21st Street. As part of the 21st Street reconstruction project, the intersection of 
21st and Douglas Avenue will be closed to all directions of traffic beginning today. 
Officials expect the intersection to be closed for approximately a month – and motorists 
are encouraged to find another way to reach their destination during this time.
0:60 each For the second time since this spring Yankton residents have received word that the city’s
water system is out of compliance due to higher-than-normal levels of trihalomethanes 
(THMs). The standard for THMS is 80 micrograms per liter, but over the last year, the 
city has averaged 87.4, 89.80 and 98.74 micrograms per liter. Director of Environmental 
Services Kyle Goodmanson says the THMs are a result of the city’s chlorine treatment 
process. According to Goodmanson the chlorine is added to the water to disinfect it and 
kill any microbial growth. The chlorine interacts with the organic material in the water 
and gives a byproduct that forms the THMs. Goodmanson said due to some extremely 
high runoff events as well as some basins being out of service because of construction, 
there was a lot of extra nutrients in the water. Those solids are what the chlorine reacts 
with and causes the THMs. Even with the levels, Goodmanson said there isn’t a major 
threat to the public at this time. He added that THMs are a potential cancer causing 
problem, but only with really excessive levels in the water for a prolonged period of time.
He said it’s very unlikely to happen and called the information is being shared at this time
as more of a precaution. The city’s new water plant, an addition to the 1972 plant, is set 
to begin coming online in the fall. Along with it will come regular water sourcing that 
nearly eliminates the causes of THMs.

temporary bridge’s opening stating Nebraska’s road to recovery continues to move 
forward with the temporary structure marking another milestone in the state’s efforts to 
rebuild. Ricketts called the opening of Highway 12 a key link in establishing connectivity
for local residents, the community, travelers, and commerce in the area, which have all 
been so profoundly impacted by the flood damage. A community event will be held on 
tomorrow to mark the reopening of Highway 12. The event will be held on the west end 
of the Mormon Canal Bridge just east of where the temporary road diverges to the bridge.
0:60 each The University of South Dakota School of Law welcomed one of the largest incoming 
classes of students in 10 years yesterday. Eighty-seven students representing 14 states 
comprise the Class of 2022. USD Law Professor Hannah Haksgaard said this year’s 
incoming class is one of the largest she’s seen in some time. Haksgaard adds that rural 
South Dakota continues to have a lawyer shortage, and having a large incoming class 
allows for the possibility of sending more graduates into rural practice in the coming 
years. The school educates most of the state’s lawyers and judges, filling spots in private 
law firms and in public legal practice.
0:60 each An ATV accident in Yankton sent four people to the hospital Sunday evening. According

for a year. Yankton County Commissioner Gary Swensen was sent a letter by Yankton’s 
city attorney outlining the ban. In the letter, City Attorney Ross Den Herder says

elected officials.” According to reports, Yankton Mayor Nathan Johnson appeared before 
the commission last week about Swensen’s posting of a cartoon on social media. The 
cartoon shows a priest telling a woman who confessed to killing a politician that he is 
“here to listen to your sins, not your community service work.” Swensen has apologized

was made earlier in the week at the Yankton Area Progressive Growth quarterly meeting.

site search and will be building a 25,000 plus square foot package sort facility in 
Yankton. The building permit’s valuation is $3.7 million and the center will be located in

Mingo was unsure of how many employees would be hired and didn’t have an exact

Thursday afternoon near Parkston, South Dakota. A Ford Ranger was northbound on

injuries. A 16-year-old male was transported to the Parkston hospital. The two other

0:60 each The Nebraska Lottery says someone who bought a Powerball ticket in Schuyler, 
Nebraska, has won $1 million. The ticket was purchased at the Parkview One Stop on 
Colfax Street in Schuyler. It matched the first five numbers drawn Saturday night, but

0:60 each In an effort to prepare for unknown emergencies, the Yankton County Emergency 
Management Office is looking for Point of Dispensing (POD) help for rapid response 
needs. According to Public Information Officer Cherie Hoffman, POD is a group of 
volunteers who get together to help prepare and exercise in case there is a disaster 
involving dispensing disease-prevention medication. Yankton and Bon Homme counties 
have a total of about 30,000 citizens and Hoffman says if called, those who are part of 
POD would organize within 24 hours and be ready to help citizens receive medications, 
vaccines or medical supplies, all within a 48-hour period. She states it’s a big undertaking
that is critical to the health and safety of those in Yankton and the surrounding 
communities. The emergency dispensing group won’t just be giving shots and passing 
out medication. The emergency management office is seeking volunteers with all types of
backgrounds, skills and training. There is no deadline for folks to apply for POD, and 
those interested should contact the Yankton County Emergency Management office.
0:60 each Northeast Community College is ready to launch a major initiative that will impact its 
agriculture programming for years to come. College administrators, campaign 
representatives and others are gathering today at the Chuck M. Pohlman Agriculture 
Complex to kick-off the Nexus capital campaign in hopes to raise funds to construct new 
agriculture facilities on the Northeast campus in Norfolk. Dr. Tracy Kruse, associate vice 
president of development and external affairs and executive director of the college 
foundation, says today’s event will share more about the $23 million project. Kruse states

College will continue to be responsive to the ever-changing needs of agriculture, its 
communities, and businesses.
0:60 each Yankton County is making plans to place more emphasis on road repairs while also 
replacing aging bridges. The decision was made by the commissioners at a special budget
meeting earlier this month. Funding for the James River bridge will remain at $250,000 
for fiscal year 2020. The plan is to replace the four James River bridges in order of 
priority over a period of time. Commissioners also decided to allocate more funds next 
year for road maintenance, as well as restored some cuts in the provisional budget. The 
board said they didn’t fund some things they wanted to but feel they did reach a 
compromise with the newest budget draft. According to the County, the decisions aren’t 
yet final, as the commissioners will pass the final version of the budget at their 
September 3rd meeting.
0:60 each Fire heavily-damaged a home in Hartford, South Dakota over the weekend. The call

arrived on the scene. Everyone in the home got out safely and without injuries. The cause
of the fire is under investigation.
0:60 each A Yankton woman has been arrested and charged for making a bomb threat to a school in 
Creighton, Nebraska, on August 21st. According to court documents, 34-year old Christi 
Johnson has been charged with false reporting. According to authorities, on the afternoon 
of August 21st, the principal of Creighton Public Schools contacted the Creighton Police 
Department stating the school had received a bomb threat. Reports say the person who 
made the threat claimed that a Robert said there was a bomb in the school – and 
apparently the call was made from an application on Johnson’s phone. Shortly after 9 
p.m. that night Knox County authorities received a call from Johnson at her home in 
Yankton, claiming she had called in the threat to the Creighton Public Schools. According
to the arrest warrant, when authorities spoke with Johnson in the early morning hours of 
August 22nd, she claimed she was told by a friend of her ex-boyfriend that police were 
closing in on her ex-boyfriend. She said she decided on the bomb threat to create a 
diversion using the app called ‘TextNow’. According to the arrest warrant, Johnson said 
she felt guilty about the threat and contacted authorities to confess.

forward to continuing recovery efforts with leaders in Lake Andes and other communities
impacted by spring storms and flooding.
0:60 each Hundreds of people gathered Sunday to show their support for a South Dakota National 
Guard unit set to deploy for Europe. A deployment ceremony was held over the weekend 
in Aberdeen for the 114 soldiers of Alpha Battery, 1-147th Field Artillery Battalion and 
the 147th Forward Support Company. Several dignitaries attended the ceremony, 
including South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, Senator John Thune, and Representative

Operation Atlantic Resolve, which includes training and support efforts with U.S. allies 
in eastern Europe.
0:60 each A Bloomfield, Nebraska, man is in custody as the result of an investigation by the Knox 
County Sheriff’s Office and the Bloomfield Police Department. According to court 
documents, 43-year old Patrick Cihlar was arrested in connection with an alleged 
burglary in a rural Knox County residence on August 25th. An arrest warrant was issued 
by the Knox County Court and Cihlar was arrested last week in Omaha and is currently 
being held in the Douglas County Corrections Center.
0:60 each Following weeks of discussion and review of proposed controversial budget cuts, the 
Yankton County Commission has finalized its budget for 2020. County Commissioners 
took action on the $15 million budget Tuesday night, leaving intact the figures from the 
provisional budget which was approved in August. Commissioner Cheri Loest was not 
available for the vote, however, the budget was passed 3-1, with Dan Klimisch, Joe Healy
and Don Kettering in favor and Gary Swensen against. In the end, the final document 
represents about $26,000 in proposed cuts. The final budget figures came to $18,000 for

0:60 each Officials at Pender Public Schools in Pender, Nebraska, say they have a confirmed case 
of the mumps inside the building. That information was released in a letter sent to parents
on September 3rd. According to the letter, the suspected case of mumps was identified

of any symptoms.
0:60 each Two officers were sworn into the Norfolk Police Division late last week. Officer Chris 
Hansen and Officer Collin Jurgensmeier just completed a seven-week in-house training. 
They will now head to the Nebraska Law Enforcement Training Center for another 16 
weeks of training. Following that they will be assigned to a Field Training Officer for

sworn in by Madison County Judge Ross Stoffer. 
0:60 each A single vehicle crash Sunday evening in Lyon county Iowa has claimed the life of a 
 reports from the Iowa State Patrol, 40-year-old 
South Dakota woman. According to 
Barbara Rozeboom of Canton was driving a 2012 Honda Odyssey northbound near the

0:60 each A Norfolk, Nebraska, man has been sentenced in federal court for conspiracy to distribute
methamphetamine. According to reports, 42-year-old Christopher Harmeier was 
sentenced to 63-months in prison for the crime. In 2017, law enforcement began 
investigating a drug trafficking organization they say was transporting large amounts of 
meth into Lincoln, Nebraska. According to investigators, the meth was redistributed to 
local distributors, which included Harmeier in Norfolk. Harmeier was found to have two 
pounds of meth and $10,000 in his possession. The Drug Enforcement Administration, 
assisted by the Lincoln Police Department and Nebraska State Patrol, conducted the 
investigation.
0:60 each A mosquito species native to tropical climates and known to carry the Zika virus has been
found in Nebraska. State health officials released information stating that the Aedes 
aegypti mosquito was recently found in southeastern Nebraska’s York County. Health 
officials say this type of mosquito bites primarily in the daytime, only feeds on people, 
and can only fly about 500 feet. Besides Zika, it’s been known to spread other types of 
fever including yellow fever and dengue fever. One state epidemiologist says the spread 
of such diseases would require an infected person to be bitten by the mosquito that would
then have to bite an uninfected person, making the risk of such infections in Nebraska 
low.
0:60 each A Stanton, Nebraska, man is scheduled to be sentenced November 12th for the crash death
of another driver. Stanton County Court records say 19-year-old Ried Krutz pleaded no 
contest Tuesday to misdemeanor vehicular homicide. Authorities say a pickup truck 
driven by Krutz crossed the Nebraska Highway 24 center line on May 6th and struck an 
oncoming sport utility vehicle being driven by 63-year-old Jim Hoff, of Norfolk. The

0:60 each The state of Nebraska has approved $3 million in grants to help communities recover and
rebuild from flooding that happened this past spring. Six Nebraska communities will 
each receive $500,000 to help with projects related to housing. They include Nebraska 
City, Fremont, Peru, Lynch, Wood River and Pierce County. The money will help pay to 
demolish some houses in the flood plain, rebuild or rehabilitate some homes and help 
some families with down payments on new homes. The Nebraska Department of 
Economic Development used money from an affordable housing program to pay for the 
grants to help communities recover after the severe spring flooding.
0:60 each The City of Yankton Street Department wants to let residents know that the railroad 
crossing between West 15th Street/Locus Street to Railroad Street will be closed today. 
The closure is to allow Burlington Northern Railroad to make signal repairs. The street 
could remain closed for two to three days. No traffic will be allowed and residents are 
asked to alter routes to avoid the street closure area.
0:60 each Yankton officials say the City’s Transfer Station will be open for no cost disposal of flood
damaged debris from affected properties within Yankton County. Only flood damaged 
items from residents within the county are eligible to use the transfer station for this 
purpose and participants must show verification of name and address. Loads must be 
flood damaged materials, and folks are asked not to include items not impacted by the 
flood – if not followed, authorities say the community’s ability to apply for disaster aid 
funding programs will be hindered. Drop off started Wednesday and will run through 
October 19th. Some examples of eligible storm damaged items include damaged sheet 
rock, carpet, and other building materials; furniture and other flood damaged household 
items, and tree branches. Some items not eligible include tires, refrigerators, and air 
conditioners. Folks who have been affected by the recent flooding can find out more by 
accessing the Yankton County Emergency Management website or by calling the office 
directly.
0:60 each South Dakota’s attorney general will investigate Minnehaha County’s top prosecutor over
his absence from work. Governor Kristi Noem sent a letter Wednesday to Attorney 
General Jason Ravnsborg requesting an investigation of State’s Attorney Aaron 
McGowan. McGowan was out of his office starting in mid-July, returning to work on 
September 9th. McGowan reportedly was out for medical reasons. In her letter to 
Ravnsborg, Noem cited the prosecutor’s “extended absence” and said “an investigation is
necessary to determine if grounds for removal exist or not.” McGowan said he welcomes 
the investigation and “looks forward to an accurate and credible determination of the 
facts.” McGowan was first elected in 2008 to serve as the attorney overseeing South 
Dakota’s most populous county.
0:60 each The flooding took over parts of eastern South Dakota and for some, it's the third time this
year. The Yankton Sioux Tribe is doing everything they can to help their people, but 
many homes were damaged due to the high flows of water and the group has been 
fighting off the water with most of it coming from Lake Andes. As homes continue to be 
affected, tribal leaders are being asked what they plan to do to help those living in the 
flooded area. According to Yankton Sioux Tribe Secretary Glenford “Sam” Sully, they 
have been working as diligently as they can with the resources they have. Earlier this 
spring, Governor Noem helped the reservation and neighboring towns by raising the 
main road, but that's now back underwater so they're asking for the state's help yet again. 
The Chief of Police states the continued flooding is taking a toll on patrol vehicles. 
Authorities are also concerned about delayed response times for emergencies if the roads 
are closed off by water, calling it a life or death kind of situation. Even though trenches 
have been dug to try to alleviate some of the issue, it really hasn’t been working. Now, 
the moisture is creating mold in the homes and affecting the air – that according to 
Yankton Sioux Tribe Chairman, Robert Flying Hawk. Tribal members say the flooding 
has affected their livelihood and they are trying to find solutions that will once again 
bring hope to current and future Yankton Sioux Tribal members.
0:60 each Health officials in South Dakota are now reporting six cases of vaping-related illnesses in
the state. Ages of patients are ranging from 18 to 44 years old. Recnetly the CDC has 
confirmed 530 cases of vaping related illnesses throughout the country. These increased 
numbers are prompting public health directors across the state to urge those using e-
cigarettes and vaping products to stop until health officials can investigate these products 
and the vaping-related illnesses.
0:60 each It appears that the summer of 2019 was once again fruitful for the city of Yankton’s sales 
tax revenue. During a recent media preview City Manager Amy Leon said the city saw 
August sales tax record a 3.93% gain over the same month in 2018. Leon said the city is 
finishing up the summer season in the middle of the pack statewide, but adds overall, the 
city is up 3.58% over this same time period last year. Though major retailers such as JC 
Penney and K-Mart have vacated the city over the last few years, Leon said she’s still 
seeing area businesses well-utilized by residents and non-residents alike.
0:60 each The Missouri River is slowly receding at Dakota Dunes and managers of the Dakota 
Dunes Community Improvement District sent out a letter to residents on Tuesday. 
Information in the letter stated that they have seen a “slight” reduction in the river level 
along the upriver end of Dakota Dunes. However, they say, water is still high on the 
upstream Missouri River levees and the levee along the Big Sioux River and officials 
continue to monitor them. National Weather Service projections show a one-foot drop by 
this morning. In the meantime, the community’s storm water inlets are still plugged and 
pumps are in place to evacuate storm water.
0:60 each Residents of Union, Clay, and Yankton Counties will have an opportunity to safely 
dispose of household hazardous waste in the coming week. Officials in the counties will 
collect hazardous waste materials October 4th and 5th at a cost of $10 per vehicle to help 
defray collection costs. The two-day collection provides for residents to dispose of 
products containing harmful chemicals which could present a threat to the environment if
not handled and gotten rid of according to directions. Materials collected will be recycled
or disposed in hazardous waste landfills or incinerators. The scheduled collections are as 
follows: Friday, October 4th from 2 to 4pm at the Vermillion Missouri Valley Recycling 
Center in Vermillion, and at Yankton Transfer & Recycling on Saturday, October 5th from 
9am to 1pm. For a list of examples of household hazardous waste materials, click on this

about 47% of those same students were proficient in math for their respective grade 
levels, and roughly 40% of students were proficient in science. Governor Noem said she 
was unimpressed with the results, especially in light of a recent pay boost for South 
Dakota teachers approved in 2016.
The City Commission recently voted unanimously to approve a 20-year opt-out of
the state property tax freeze to help pay for a proposed $15 million aquatic center 
to replace the aging Fantle Memorial Park pool.
The pool is 71 years old. The citizen group Dive In Yankton has been working to 
get it replaced, and has raised about $870,000 toward the cause. The city earlier 
committed $2 million toward the project.
Any opponents of the property tax increase could still refer the commission’s 
decision to a public vote by collecting enough petition signatures.
If that doesn’t happen, construction of the aquatic center could begin next 
summer and be completed within two years.
