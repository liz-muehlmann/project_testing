Backyard Gardeners Can Donate Veggies Through

Celebrate Recovery Continues to Meet Despite COVID-19
Stay-at-home orders required the Christ-centered 12-step 
program to adopt virtual alternatives to traditional face-
to-face meetings. K-LOVE's Frank Hammond asks Christe 
Dejorie, South Carolina Celebrate Recovery state rep 
about online groups, anonymity, and confidentiality rules 
for Zoom meetings and plans to go forward with the 
annual Celebrate Recovery conference in July.

We talked about the food needs before and after the 
pandemic and how things changed, how needs are met to 
be safe for everyone.  One of the big issues was the 
number of young families coming to the pantry and how 
many added children that wouldn't be eating meals at 
school during the lockdown.  About a 25% increase. The 
needs are met by the Denmark Community Cupboard and 
also Ruby's Pantry.  Pastor Andy is the Site Coordinator for 
both organizations in Denmark.  We talked about where 
the food comes from, and how its distributed. There is 
great community support for the Cupboard both by 
monetary and food donations.

‘Adulting 101’ Class Offers Students Practical Skills for Life
A group of Round Rock, Texas students are learning some 
basic life skills to help them face the real world.  In 
Adulting 101, teens are learning how to cook, handle 
finances, craft a resume, interview for a job and 
more. Debbie and co-librarian Claire Jones got help from 
community partners from Touchpoint chefs, who provide 
the chef service for Seton hospitals in Texas to teach the 
cooking classes and A-Plus Credit Union donated their 
time for the classes in money management, savings, a 
credit 101 class. Other classes offered helped students 
learn to create a resume and interview for a job. With 
more volunteers jumping on board, students are looking 
forward to future classes on automotive basics, home 
organizing and even laundry and basic mending skills.

#LoveThe760: Ensuring Vulnerable Kids Get Good Food 
During the Summer
The overall theme for Venture Church nowadays is “Love 
the 760,” branded as #LoveThe760 on social media. There 
are many elements to this project, which is named for the 
telephone area code 760 that’s assigned to Encinitas, 
California and surrounding area. One example of how the 
church members have been blessing the community, on 
Fridays – before weekends began - church volunteers 
would drop off backpacks filled with food so the schools 
could distribute to children who were from “food insecure 
homes.” Pastor Troy Martin shares that about 40 families 
were directly helped each weekend. And that was before 
the COVID-19 pandemic hit. “But once the pandemic hit, 
the numbers jumped to 220-plus families. Our church 
really rallied around it. People brought in donations. 
People helped pack, helped organize. People gave funds 
toward the project just to be a blessing and help people in 
their time of need.” Pastor Troy wants the church to “live 
on mission to the community.” He says it’s not like, “'Oh, 
we hope the community comes into our building as part of 
one of our services', but, no, we want to go and love the 
community and bless the community and really be Jesus 
to the community.” 
High School Graduation Is Virtual, But Class President 
Encourages, Offers Original Song
The graduation ceremony for the Class of 2020 at Lejeune 
High School in North Carolina turned out to be unlike 
anything students and parents had ever imagined. The 
graduates celebrated online, due to COVID-19 pandemic 
restrictions. Senior Class President Abigail Paquin 
presented her encouraging video speech and then sat 
down to sing an original song that she wrote for the 
special and unusual occasion. The speech and song took 
focus, hard work, and prayer. “I was definitely 
disappointed, but I was not surprised and it was kind of 
hard to think that after these past few years of going to 
my school’s graduations and seeing my senior friends 
every year graduating – knowing that I wouldn’t have 
that – it was definitely really sad.” Abigail adds, “I was 
praying a lot and I was asking the Lord ‘why, why is this 
happening?’” The Lord gave her a peace about the 
situation and Abigail then knew “I had to encourage my 
classmates.”

Children’s Pastor Takes 'Mister Rogers Approach' Sharing 
Valuable Lessons During Pandemic
As the COVID-19 pandemic arrived, Pastor Land decided to 
offer a video series, based on a Mister Rogers approach, to 
help children comprehend and cope with all the changes 
taking place. “So far, our messages have been about 
wearing masks and the importance of masks and why you 
shouldn’t be afraid to wear the mask…and you can protect 
yourself from getting it.” Land did another show about 
understanding illness. “We have a staff member who has 
cancer and so when the kids come back, I wanted them 
not to be afraid of her because she’s lost her hair. Another 
show touched on wild weather. “We are in the Houston 
area, so we do have the threat of hurricanes [in 2017, 
Hurricane Harvey brought catastrophic flooding and 
damage to Houston]. And we’ve done another one about 
manners – honestly, we’re just talking to kids about, you 
know, right now is a good time to hone in on their 
manners. And when you use good manners, you’re not 
just showing respect, you’re also showing love and respect 
for God.”
High School Students Train Service Dogs to Save Lives
Cuddly, adorable puppies are invading a high school in 
Texas. They’re a cute diversion from the routine of a 
normal school day but it’s also serving a vital purpose. 
The pups are being trained at Wimberley High to become 
diabetic alert dogs. Tiffany Black is the agriculture science 
teacher. Black says, “Three of my students are partnered 
with three puppies. So, it’s their responsibility to care for 
the puppies. They get to take them home. They’re 
responsible for that basic training and socialization. And 
then they bring those puppies to school and we work with 
them in our classrooms, continuing those basic 
techniques.” Once fully trained, the dogs will help alert 
their owners in case their blood sugar drops. Truly a life-
saving skill. But Tiffany says the animals need to learn how 
to conduct themselves no matter where they are to get 
them ready for their upcoming jobs. 
Woman's Blog Unites Millions of Moms Across Country

Worship Leader Shares Deep Concerns About U.S. Pastors' 
Mental Health, Especially During Pandemic
Cody Barnhart is director of music and ministry at First 
Baptist Church in Alcoa, Tennessee. As we share this story, 
you may sense that he has wisdom beyond-his-years when 
it comes to troublesome issues that often haunt pastors, 
even veteran pastors. But this is not a story of 
discouragement - stay with us. Cody explains he “grew up 
with a lot of anxiety issues and depression as a teenager,” 
which persisted during his time in seminary. He eventually 
realized how much this had impacted him. “Since it had 
affected me so personally, I’ve been pretty passionate 
about shedding light on how deep that issue runs in the 
church.” He recently wrote a first-person article published 
online by Baptist Press that spoke of the mental health 
risks that can tag even a servant of God. Sadly, there have 
been as a number of cases where pastors have apparently 
taken their own lives, including one pastor who had even 
led a mental health advocacy group. Join our conversation 
in this podcast as Cody lays out the dark threats often 
circling pastors and suggests practical ways to encourage 
church leaders. 
Food Literacy Center: Working with Public Schools to 
Educate Kids About Eating Healthy
Children at risk of developing obesity or Type 2 diabetes 
are learning healthy eating habits through the Food 
Literacy Center in Sacramento, California. The Center’s 
founder Amber Stott says, “It’s critical that we reach kids 
at a very early age before they develop bad habits to help 
them develop good ones.” 
Socially Distanced Encouragement: Kindergarten Teacher 
Met with Drive-By Cheers After Last Cancer Treatment
After completing her last day of chemo for breast cancer, 
kindergarten teacher Jennifer Owens had to avoid 
personal contact to stay safe from the COVID-19 virus. But 
that didn’t stop people from encouraging her! 250 cars 
with family, friends and students surprised her with a huge 
parade outside of her home in Hammond, Louisiana. 
Jennifer’s daughter Emily came from college to take care 
of her and said they’d sing Christian songs together. “We 
would play K-LOVE and she would sing to me and dance 
while we waited for the spinal taps to be done.” Emily, 
Jennifer’s daughter, has helped her post weekly Facebook 
live updates on their “Faith over Fear” page and Jennifer 
has continued to have story time online for her 
kindergarten students. She wants to let her “babies” know 
that she’s doing great. Jennifer’s daughter Emily came 
from college to take care of her and said they’d sing 
Christian songs together. “We would play K-LOVE and she 
would sing to me and dance while we waited for the spinal 
taps to be done.”

Veterans Proud to Serve Again - As Teachers
Veterans are transitioning from a life of service for their 
country to a life of service in their communities through a 
program called Troops To Teachers. Troops To Teachers 
operates in each state. Once current members of the 
Armed Forces or those who have been honorably 
discharged apply, the national office notifies candidates. 
Vane says the impact isn’t just on students but veterans 
who choose the program. “I think many people get 
involved in the military as a way of service. And then of 
course in the medical field as a way of service. And so I 
think both Dr. Perrin and I…what caught our eye with 
Troops to Teachers is that motto: ‘Proud to serve again.’”
Giving Back in The Pandemic – Allen Marshall Buys Gas for 
Nurses
At a busy intersection near three Detroit hospitals, Allen 
Marshall did something unusual and very generous. He 
made arrangements with a gas station, then stood outside 
with his “Free Gas for Nurses” sign. The $900 he spent 
blessed a lot of very surprised medical workers. The 
money was a bit of a sacrifice. It had been set aside for 
Allen’s mother’s 97th birthday and for a tool he wanted for 
his knife-sharpening business. But since his mother was at 
a senior home, they couldn’t have a party – and the tool, 
well it could wait. This was more important to Allen and 
his wife, who works in the insurance medical field. 
Feeding The 5,000 – Church Team Blesses Community
Thousands affected by the COVID-19 lockdown received 
free groceries in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Journey Church and 
their disaster response team handed out the food as 
people drove through their parking lot. Pastor Bob Griffith 
with Journey Church says their Disaster Response Team is 
ready to jump into action during emergencies. The team 
coordinated with four counties, food distributers, 
manufacturers and others to bless people during the 
COVID-19 situation.

Extreme Generosity: Life Church Helps 25,000 Additional 
Churches Livestream During Pandemic
When businesses and schools closed as the COVID-19 
pandemic hit America, almost all churches stopped in-
person worship as well. Crowds were a risk of spreading 
the aggressive virus. Some churches were familiar with 
livestreaming services, but many had not done that 
before. Pastors realized the internet was about the only 
way to share sermons and live worship with the millions of 
families now staying at home for safety. But how? For 
25,000 churches there was a quick and reliable solution – 
the Church Online Platform software developed 
by Life.Church, whose home church is based in Oklahoma, 
with campuses in 11 states. Incredibly, thankfully, 
Life.Church believes in offering whatever help they can 
free-of-charge to other churches. So, for 25,000 churches 
the ability to bring their services online in high quality was 
just a matter of downloading the platform and learning. 
No charge. No strings attached.
‘Helping Others Can Help You’ – Rock Church Helps with 
Food, Looks Ahead Past COVID-19
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, San Diego-based Rock 
Church was always helping areas of the community with 
hunger and other needs. But, “when the pandemic hit, we 
just put that into overdrive,” explains Senior Pastor Miles 
McPherson. “I think one of the things that hopefully a lot 
of people have learned is…one of the ways to get your 
mind off yourself is to think about other people. You can 
sit at home and go crazy thinking about the ‘what if’ 
scenarios about your money, ‘what if’ scenarios about 
your future,” but McPherson recommends connecting to 
others can be “somewhat therapeutic.” Rock Church 
volunteers repaired and delivered 263,000 N95 masks to 
San Diego’s Office of Emergency Services. These 
respirators were placed into the County of San Diego’s 
Medical Operations Center’s warehouse for use by Health 
Care Workers. 4,284 church volunteers served in three-
hour time shifts for a total of 12,852 hours. With the help 
of restaurants and the community, the church provided 
thousands of meals to 13 hospitals in San Diego County to 
encourage “frontline hospital heroes.”

Pandemic Takes Creative Teaching to A New Level with 
Daily Character Videos
Yoda teaching English grammar? Mixed up idea, it is. 
Unless you’re Cedarville University alumna Heidi Bruder 
trying to spice up language arts for her suddenly online 
fifth through seventh graders at Calvary Christian 
Academy in West Branch, Michigan. Then it’s an idea that 
would make a Jedi master proud. Bruder usually teaches a 
very interactive class, so this March when students 
switched to online learning, she was at a loss for what to 
do. “Switching to online learning was heartbreaking for 
me,” explained Bruder. “It was hard for me to want to 
make the videos and teach the lessons because everything 
I loved about teaching, I felt was being stripped away. But 
I was convicted by what I tell my kids all the time: 
Whatever you do, do it for the Lord.”
Bob ‘The Bike Man’ & Police Encourage Kids
A volunteer police officer is helping to build a better 
relationship between kids living in poor communities and 
police officers patrolling these neighborhoods. Bob 
Charland, also known as “Bob the Bike Man,” has 
partnered up with several law enforcement agencies 
throughout Massachusetts and Connecticut, collecting 
donated bikes, refurbishing them, then delivering the 
bikes to poor kids right to their schools. Bob believes 
changing the dynamic between the kids and police officers 
is important to encourage respect and understanding 
between both.
Helping, Hands On: Christian Nursing Students Assist 
Health Dept. With Virus Response
It’s quite an honor when the county health department 
calls on a university for help, knowing by previous 
interaction that the Christian school’s nursing program is 
first-class. That’s what happened for the Betty M. Dean 
School of Nursing at Simpson University based in Redding, 
California. When the COVID-19 pandemic started taking 
hold, the Shasta County Health and Human Services 
Agency requested volunteers from Simpson’s program. 
There was a need for medically aware people, with a 
human touch, to respond to numerous phone calls from 
area residents who were concerned about the pandemic. 
“The peace and the comfort that the students can bring 
has a really deep effect” and Becky reminds us “that’s 
what nurses do, and which is also the role of the body of 
Christ in so many ways.”

Quarantine Drives Spike in Domestic Abuse
Physical bruises are only small part of what some women 
and men suffer, says Annette Oltmans of The MEND 
Project, which brings awareness to what she calls ‘covert 
emotional abuse.’  "Victims begin questioning reality and 
their own sanity,” she explains, herself a survivor of 
domestic abuse – and a Christian – who knows firsthand 
what’s it like to ‘live it.’  Pastor Paul Cole, president of the 
Christian Men’s Network, has been deeply concerned by 
the quarantine effect on families already stuffed in a 
pressure cooker of unhealthy reactions. “A lot of times, we 
as men act out of anger, rage, disappointment – and we 
lash out at people,” he says, and urges men in this trap to 
reach out for help. K-LOVE's Billie Branham reports.

‘Rest’ Is More Than Sleep – What Kind of Tired Are You?
Rest is the root of the word ‘restoration’ – and restoration 
is a principle that medical internist Dr. Saundra Dalton-
Smith sees as crucial to seven distinct areas of your life. 
“Rest isn’t just the cessation of activity,” she says, 
suggesting that for optimal health “you have to get to the 
point of knowing what restores you. What fills you back 
up?” 
7 types of Rest: Physical, Mental, Emotional, Spiritual, 
Social, Sensory and Creative.

It Doesn't Have to End This Way: Suicide Prevention
If someone decides to end their own life, you may never 
fully understand why. "But you can imagine how much 
psychological pain that person had to be in," says Pat 
Gallinaugh of Range Suicide Prevention Council.
But it doesn't have to end that way. Suicide can be 
prevented.  Talking is where it starts.  
"Say, 'yeah we see you’re hurting, you’re in a lot of pain' --

CALL THE NAT'L SUICIDE HOTLINE 1-800-273 TALK (8255)
Sometimes no matter how hard you try it’s all just ‘too 
much’.  And that’s okay.  If you or someone you know is 
thinking of suicide call the national hotline. TALK. You are 
loved.
Or call the K-LOVE PASTORS: 1-844-364-HOPE (4673).
Count Everyone! Everyone Counts! (My2020Census.gov)
My2020Census time! Every 10 years, every person on U.S. 
soil is required to be counted, by order of the Constitution. 
For households that don't respond as required, a census 
taker will knock on their door. No area is too remote. No 
outskirts too far. “Census takers are in rural parts of Alaska 
on snowmobiles,” Cook says, and for coastal fringes, 
“census takers will kayak to communities that are not 
connected to roads.”  K-LOVE'S Marya Morgan talks with 
Michael Cook of the U.S. Census Bureau about how the 
numbers are used and Rev. Dr. Marlyn Bussey, pastor of 
St. James AME Zion Church about why she thinks faith 
leaders should actively encourage people to participate.

Training Students for The Tech World with Christian Values
Graduating from college is a dream come true for many 
students. Some students however are finding it hard to 
find good paying jobs despite their time spent in school. 
Talent and education is there, but some companies are 
requiring a little bit more. Ryan Collins is CEO of Bethel 
School of Technology in Redding, California and says 
learning character principles like trust and community is 
valuable, especially when trying to land that great job. 
“We just love the idea that we can equip believers to go 
into this space and do things with excellence, create a 
really good career for themselves, but also, be able to 
represent and be ambassadors for the love of Christ.” 
‘The Corona Chronicles’ – A Message Born Out of 
Circumstances
Kenny Luck, the founder of Every Man Ministries, 
understands some of the unique challenges men are 
experiencing with social-distancing and staying-at-home 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. And it might be smart for 
women to take note of this as well to get a sense of what 
the men in your family might be going through.  
‘Lasagna Lady’ Michelle Brenner Is Bringing Comfort To 
Her Hometown, One Lasagna At A Time
After being furloughed from her job as a sales manager, 
Michelle Brenner decided to fill her time helping others. 
She was shopping for food to help seniors when she was 
inspired to make homemade lasagna for those who 
couldn’t get out during the shelter-in-place orders. What 
started out as a simple post on her neighborhood 
Facebook page offering to cook and deliver homemade, 6-
pound pans of lasagna ended up with a town filled with a 
hunger for lasagna. Now known as the “Lasagna Lady,” 
Michelle Brenner guesses she’s baked more than a 
thousand pans of lasagna. She’s delivered them to fire 
departments, medical providers, prisons, the elderly and 
just about anyone who has asked. 
Prison Fellowship Helps Families Encourage Incarcerated 
Loved Ones with Messages, Photos
The creator of Flikshop learned about the tremendous 
need and got a brilliant idea from very personal 
experience. Marcus Bullock was once a prisoner himself. 
While behind bars, his mother sent him a picture and a 
note every day. Realizing the encouragement the daily 
notes gave him - once he was freed - Marcus created the 
Flikshop app. “It essentially allows you to upload pictures 
and messages to your loved ones in just a few clicks,” says 
Heather Rice-Minus, Vice President of Government Affairs 
& Church Mobilization at Prison Fellowship.

'Shower Power' Helps the Homeless Have Hope
Some homeless men and women have hope for the first 
time in Jackson, Mississippi thanks to the generosity and 
kindness of local real estate agent Teresa Renkenberger. 
Teresa has long had a heart for those less fortunate and 
has made it her personal mission to get to know men and 
women who've fallen on hard times. One day she was 
curious and asked Benny, one of her friends on the street, 
how long it had been since he'd had a hot shower. He 
revealed that it had been a year. Benny became the 
inspiration for 'Shower Power,' a mobile shower unit 
designed to bring dignity and hope to those on the street. 
Teresa's website, www.showerpower.ms says "'Shower 
Power' is more than a shower.  We want to bring 
hospitality to the streets by delivering mobile hygiene 
services to people experiencing homelessness.
Chef & Team Make Gourmet Meals to Encourage Hospital 
Staff
A Texas chef is helping feed the first responders battling 
the COVID-19 Coronavirus outbreak. Luke Rogers is 
executive chef at Savor in Klyde Warren Park in Dallas. He 
and his team have been serving hot meals weekly to the 
brave men and women risking their lives fighting this 
pandemic. “We just want to show them a big ‘thank you’ 
by what we are doing in response to what they are 
doing,” says Rogers. He says, they just want to do 
something good and continue to serve people. In the end 
he says, it doesn’t matter whether he gets his payback 
here on earth, because he’s sure he’ll get it in Heaven. 
‘Hope for The City’ – Church Led By Jud Wilhite Blesses 
Community Tremendously During Pandemic
As the COVID pandemic affected more and more lives, 
Hope for the City, an outreach launched by Central 
Christian Church, became a critical conduit for vital food 
and other supplies to those in need city-wide in the Las 
Vegas area. Pastor Jud Wilhite shares that prior to the 
pandemic, the church was “blown away to realize we were 
the largest food pantry in our state - and when the 
pandemic hit, we served more food in the first two 
weeks than we did last year!” Wilhite credits God for 
everything Hope for the City has been able to do. “We 
started pop-up food distribution sites across elementary 
school parking lots – anybody that would take us.” For 
people who may be discouraged over a job loss or just the 
pandemic restrictions causing depression, we asked if 
counseling help is available? “Absolutely! We have started 
a ministry that has really been powerful for us and I think 
made a huge difference in the lives of people. It’s called 24 
Hour Church.” A person who needs an uplift, prayer or 
guidance can call or text 1-888-805-2778 day or night to 
speak with a volunteer. Pastor Wilhite says that number is 
getting calls from “people all over the world, now.”

Igniting Trust Between People and Police – Then 
Preventing Crime
Like many cities, Kansas City, Missouri, has experienced a 
jump in crime, particularly violent crime. As a pastor and 
community leader, Darron LaMonte Edwards of United 
Believers Community Church is stepping up to help. It’s a 
concept he developed called “Getting to the Heart of the 
Matter”- ten steps intended to prevent circumstances for 
crime from happening in the first place. Pastor Edwards 
believes God wants him to “step into the gap to slow 
down, to push back darkness so that light can shine.” 
Implementation of the program has taken some time “to 
jump all the political hurdles” in the city, but now it has 
been “embraced by the chief of police and by KC PD and 
we’re beginning to see great strides happen.” 32 faith 
communities are already onboard with Getting to the 
Heart of the Matter – and Pastor Edwards says that took 
place in just two weeks.
Christian Bakery Owners Give Cash to Other Businesses 
Struggling During Pandemic
When the pandemic hit, the owners of Bear Fruit Bakery in 
Texas City, Texas saw something very unusual happen with 
their business. While other businesses around them 
seemed to be struggling during the pandemic, their bakery 
was ‘booming!’ Ryan and Kaitlin Stafford own the Bear 
Fruit bakery. And being blessed, they decided to give part 
of their earnings to other businesses, to help them stay 
afloat. “God’s been in it the whole way and He knew that 
we we’re gonna be able to do some good with it,” says 
Ryan. He says the bakery is not all about making money, 
but rather about investing in God and in people. He admits 
the business has definitely been a “blessing from God and 
His favor has been in it the whole way.”
After Rise in Fatalities, Experienced Paddler Says Safety Is 
Key This Summer
Andrea White, the Tennessee State Director of the 
American Canoe Association, is a paddling enthusiast and 
a boating safety advocate. "We come together to try to do 
good things for our rivers, to do good things for paddlers, 
to put training in place for new people coming into the 
sport and sometimes we're lobbying on behalf of the 
rivers and on behalf of the paddlers," Andrea said. 
Recently, a group of paddlers from across Tennessee came 
together to Ervin to become certified as Rescue 
Instructors. They learned how to prevent paddling deaths 
(Data from the U.S. Coast Guard's Office of Boating Safety 
shows that between 2006 and 2018, paddlecraft fatalities 
have increased by 30 percent). Regarding an increase in 
fatalities, Andrea says it "doesn't seem to be a change in 
behavior, but an increase in the popularity of the sport. 
We're trying to what we can to make things safer."

2020 – A Challenging Year for Everyone, Especially Pastors
With churches not being able to meet in-person, then in 
some cases – meeting with restrictions – and some even 
closing again – what kind of toll has this taken on pastors‘ 
work life and vital home life? Most pastors had never 
preached before an empty church – and many had to learn 
to share their message by way of a video camera. 
Brian Kluth, national spokesman for Bless Your Pastor, 
working alongside the National Association of Evangelicals, 
shares that “most of them (pastors), they have had to 
learn to develop material online, whether that’s church 
services, worship music, bible studies, even pastoral care – 
calling people, counseling – all this had to be done online, 
so it’s just taken a huge toll on pastors. Many of them are 
very tired and many of them have done their very best – 
they and their staff and volunteers – to serve the 
congregation. So, this has been a difficult year.”
"Angels" Bless Patients by Flying Them Across Country As 
Pandemic Hits
In a COVID-19 world, commercial flights can be dangerous 
for people in need of ongoing medical treatments. Angel 
Flight Northeast flies patients for free all over the country 
providing a safe alternative. Founder Larry Camerlin says 
volunteer pilots have also been delivering much needed 
basic supplies to families ‘sheltering in place’ in dozens of 
states. They’re also assisting Native American tribes. Larry 
says, “We’ve been able to ship thousands of pounds of 
soap, blankets, diapers, food to the Hopi Indians, the 
Lakota, the Navajo.” 
Dr. Mimi Secor Prescribes P.A.N.D.E.M.I.C. Weight-Loss 
And Self-Care
Dr. Mimi Secor didn’t get truly serious about her own 
weight-management and overall health until her early 
60’s. Building on her personal success and with a nod to 
current events, she offers advice cleverly corresponding 
with each of the letters of the word "pandemic." 
K-LOVE's Marya Morgan talks with Dr. Mimi about what 
she calls the '8 pillars of health.'

Here’s Expert Encouraging Advice for Parents & Students 
Doing Virtual School From Home
As millions of families enter the uncharted waters of 
virtual school from home, there is expert advice available. 
Dr. Kevin Corsini, the president of San Diego Christian 
College joins us to share tips that can make online studies 
more practical, while at the same time keeping home life 
balanced. Normally, “We have a natural boundary in place 
between work and family, and it’s called the office, or it’s 
called the school, where you go to a separate physical 
location.” But Dr. Corsini emphasizes, “And that’s 
gone…the refuge that we call home is also a classroom, is 
also the office and it’s beginning to blur the lines” of what 
needs to be a home space or a work or school 
environment. “Not only that, but it’s impacting the roles in 
the family. You know, one minute you have to be a father. 
The next minute you have to be a teacher. The next 
minute, you’re putting on your professional hat as well – 
and throughout the day, that can be very challenging.” 
There is also the factor of a student feeling marginalized. 
Many online courses are pre-recorded videos that can 
create a gap between the student and teacher/professor, 
and input and association with fellow classmates.
Dream Center Opens to Students Distance Learning
Schools are closed in Los Angeles and working parents are 
running out of options in facilitating their childrens' 
learning. The Dream Center has opened up outside areas, 
where students can be dropped off and plugged into 
online, distance learning. It's more than just meeting the 
kids with laptops and helping them do their homework, it's 
about the relational things they need to survive during this 
time. Dream Center Founder, Matthew Barnett says 
students have a bit of fun as well. Students who are 
consistent and stay focused get special treats. Those who 
need extra help get one-on-one attention. Barnett says 
families are so thankful and he's overwhelmed by the 
positive response, "It's just a happy environment and I 
think right now that's what people need more than 
anything. Our children just need some joy in their life."

Cooking With Brenda Gantt – With Moments Of Family, 
Fun & Faith, Too
Brenda Gantt is honestly surprised - and very thankful for 
what God is doing in her life. When a ‘how to make 
homemade biscuits’ video unexpectedly went viral, it was 
the start of a new chapter in her life, at age 73. Months 
later, Brenda has well over a million people following her 
on Facebook, where she offers a cooking show featuring 
recipes that often involve scrumptious Southern cooking. 
After all, Brenda and her family are in Andalusia, Alabama, 
a town of 8,700 just above the Florida Panhandle. 
Brenda’s soft-spoken cooking coaching offers step-by-step 
instructions to create fascinating dishes like: Banana Split 
Without a Banana, Old Time Chocolate Gravy, Rolled 
Chicken, and Cracklin’ Cornbread. Instead of fancy 
cookware, you see the skillets and utensils average people 
might have in their kitchen. And as Brenda stands over the 
stove keeping an eye on her food project, she will share 
things on her mind – maybe about her family or someone 
she met, and she often shares about her faith in Jesus. No 
sermons, just talking from her heart.
