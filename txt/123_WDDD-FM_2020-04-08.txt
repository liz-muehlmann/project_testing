halo' on them because people associate gyms with health. She explained why tanning beds create 
serious risks for the development of skin cancer.

Living and Working in an Age of Longevity” 
 
Many Americans have been raised on the traditional notion of a three-stage approach to life: 
education, followed by work and then retirement.  However, Prof. Scott said this well-established 
pathway is already beginning to collapse: life expectancy is rising, pensions are vanishing, and 
increasing numbers of people are juggling multiple careers.  He offered suggestions for how to better

Anna S. Mueller, PhD, Sociologist and Assistant Professor in Comparative Human Development, 
Research Associate at the Population Research Center at the University of Chicago 
 
Teen suicide clusters are a recent discovery, and little is understood about their causes and how to 
prevent them. Prof. Mueller studied the phenomenon in a small town.  She found that intense pressure 
to succeed academically and athletically, plus the ease with which private information became public, 
due to social connectedness, left teens and their parents unwilling to seek help for mental health 
problems.  She said suicide prevention strategies need to be tailored to fit the unique dynamics of 
individual communities.
