Dr. Mimi Secor didn’t get truly serious about her own weight-
management and overall health until her early 60’s. Building 
on her personal success and with a nod to current events, 
she offers advice cleverly corresponding with each of the 
letters of the word "pandemic." K-LOVE's Marya Morgan talks 
with Dr. Mimi about what she calls the '8 pillars of health.'

Trauma can settle into your mind and affect your conscious or 
subconscious no matter who you are -- or how strong you think you 
‘should’ be. K-LOVE's Monika Kelly talks with Jamie Aten, founder 
of the Humanitarian Disaster Institute which studies mental and 
emotional reactions to disasters and offers training for Christian

Physical bruises are only small part of what some women and men 
suffer, says Annette Oltmans of The MEND Project, which brings 
awareness to what she calls ‘covert emotional abuse.’  "Victims 
begin questioning reality and their own sanity,” she explains, herself 
a survivor of domestic abuse – and a Christian – who knows 
firsthand what’s it like to ‘live it.’  Pastor Paul Cole, president of the 
Christian Men’s Network, has been deeply concerned by the 
quarantine effect on families already stuffed in a pressure cooker of 
unhealthy reactions. “A lot of times, we as men act out of anger, 
rage, disappointment – and we lash out at people,” he says, and 
urges men in this trap to reach out for help. K-LOVE's Billie 
Branham reports.
