"Lulac"  has  continued  its  fight  for  years  in  the  face 
of  concerns  by  minority  groups  about  racism,  hate 
crimes  and  other  injustices.  Sindy  Benavides  chief 
executive  officer  of  the  organization,  speaks  on  this 
topic.
Racism,  police  brutality  and  more  than  two  million 
prisoners in a country where statistics reveal that the 
majority are black, followed by Latinos, would reflect 
that  perhaps  the  American  dream  has  skin  color.  Oscar 
Peralta  talks  about  his  experiences  having  been

Freedom  of  expression  and  the  defense  of  it  is 
undoubtedly one of the constitutional strengths of this 
country. There are those who say today it is in danger 
and that during the protests there were incidents where 
law  enforcement  officers  abused  those  who  peacefully 
demonstrated.  Tim  Kaine,  a  federal  senator  from 
Virginia,  co-sponsored  a  bill  to  prevent  the  use  of 
military  force  against  peaceful  protesters,  discussed 
it with Tsi-tsi-ki Felix.
For  the  organization  "Human  Rights  Watch",  police 
brutality  is  one  of  the  most  serious  human  rights 
violations  in  the  country  and  exists  at  the  national 
level  and  in  an  institutionalized  manner.  Last  year, 
1,099 people died at the hands of the police and these 
acts are repeated year after year. From Los Angeles to

cancer that has been going on for decades. However, the 
fact  that  a  medical  student  does  his  social  service 
earning $ 254 a month or a resident doctor earns $ 636

serious. This is spoken from Mexico City of Dr. Carlos
