president hoped to approve a controversial 
international loan agreement that would provide $109 
million to buy security equipment and other support for 
the president's anti-crime program. The Assembly had 
been delaying approval of the loan, motivated in part 
by political disputes with the president, some say 
having legitimate concerns about key aspects of the 
loan. But others just used as an excuse to hide 
criminals inside the Salvadorian congress who paid 
gangs to execute Salvadorians at their will. Wendy
