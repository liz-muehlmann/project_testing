Section I. Issues 
The stations have identified the following topics as significant issues facing our community in this quarter: 
A.     Health: While  many  areas  of  health  are  of  concern  in  Otsego,  Chenango  and  Delaware  County, 
Covid-19  was  the  dominant  health  issue.  Talked  to  numerous  doctors  and  local  organizations  and 
businesses about it’s impact.  After interviewing several people about COVID-19 from numerous angles it 
became apparent that locally there was a unified fight to flatten the curve.  The issue certainly got a lot 
better  later  in  the  quarter.  It  got  to  the  point  where  all  three  counties  have  been  going  several  days 
without any new cases.   
 
B.     Virtual Learning:  This became an issue because it was needed on such a wide-scale due to COVID-
19.  The hope was that schools and other forms of learning would be able to return to normal.  But 
when it became apparent that virtual learning was the way to go for the rest of the school year, 
everyone had to adapt.  The Virtual Learning issue was not contained to schools.  Other places of 
education like our local libraries adapted and offered various programs through a virtual platform. This 
was an issue because people that we interviewed said this was not an ideal situation as you are missing 
learning components by not having that traditional classroom setting.  But under the circumstances, kids 
and adults still learned and people are already turning their attention to the next academic calendar. 
C.     Poverty: Always seems to be an issue as you can see the numbers, Otsego County has 16.5 percent 
of their population living in poverty while it is at 15.3 percent for Delaware County. The state average is 
at 15 percent.  Even more staggering, in Otsego County 46 percent of schoolchildren are eligible for free 
or reduced lunches while in Delaware County that rate is at 56 percent. That was the main issue here. 
Keeping kids fed without school in session.  That was the biggest challenge facing local food pantry’s and 
organizations like Catholic Charities.  As we head into summer, the usual summer lunch programs for the 
needy will go on with social distancing and mask covering regulations set in place.    
D.     Economy: While  the  overall  impact  will  not  be  known  for  a  little  bit,  the  shutdown  of  all  non-
essential businesses negatively affected all three of our counties that we cover.  Chenango, Delaware and 
Otsego. Numbers have not been released but as was the nationwide trend there were numerous layoffs 
and  an  extremely  high  number  of  people  filing  for  unemployment.      In  Otsego  County,  the  economic 
outlook is so bleak that they had to cut 59 County employees.  The Board said the layoffs and other budget 
cuts were necessary because of a huge decline in sales tax money.   
E.     Summer Safety: This is an issue that cropped up late in this quarter but due to a number of 
firework related accidents in the summer of 2019 this was an issue that was addressed on our airwaves 
as 4th of July is right around the corner.  We heard from the Norwich Police Chief, Norwich Fire Chief and 
the Injury Prevention Coordinator for Bassett Hospital.  There was a common theme in the messaging 
from all three.  Kids have to stay away and keep their distance.  Fireworks should only be handled by 
professionals.  The other summer safety issue addressed was as the temps heat up do not leave pets 
and children in the hot vehicle. Studies say it can take just 15 minutes for a child in a hot car to suffer 
life-threatening brain or kidney injuries

Health- Oneonta Mayor Gary Herzig discussed the 
city's response to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.  While

Environment- Karen Sullivan from Otsego Solid Waste 
provided us with pertinent information about what’s 
going on with her agency during the ongoing crisis.

even realize the impact that COVID-19 is having as far 
as solid waste is concerned.   
Poverty- Lynn Glueckert, Executive Director of 
Catholic Charities for Delaware, Otsego and Schoharie 
Counties, says they have been very busy during the

of what Catholic Charities does, so getting a sense of 
what the client needs over the phone has been 
challenging.   
Health- Kelly McGraw, Director of Access from Helios 
Care in Oneonta discussed a virtual workshop they are 
having for National Health Care Decisions Day.
